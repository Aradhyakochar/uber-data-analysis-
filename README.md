# Uber Rides Data Analysis

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the **Uber rides dataset**, which includes ride details such as trip duration, pickup locations, drop-off locations, time of day, and more. The goal of this project is to uncover patterns and trends in the Uber rides data to gain insights into ride behavior, peak hours, popular locations, and other relevant factors.

## Project Overview

In this project, I conducted a thorough analysis of the Uber dataset, performing tasks such as:
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, formatting data for easier analysis, and transforming the dataset to make it more structured.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Using libraries such as **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data analysis and **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for creating meaningful visualizations.
- **Trend Analysis**: Identified peak times, average trip duration, busiest locations, and other insights related to Uber ride patterns.
- **Statistical Modeling**: Applied regression techniques and hypothesis testing to uncover deeper trends and factors influencing Uber rides.

## Key Insights

- Identification of peak ride times based on hourly, daily, and weekly analysis.
- Correlation between trip duration and distance traveled.
- Popular pickup and drop-off locations in different cities.
- Insights into factors such as weather, traffic, and events affecting ride duration and demand.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **NumPy**
